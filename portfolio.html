                <p>
                    The following application enables users to play a word guessing game on the command line. Users
                    guess the individual
                    letters of a word and are given a fixed amount of tries. The application interacts with the user
                    depending on whether or not their guess was correct and reveals the word, as correctly guessed,
                    along the way.

                    <h4>Retail Store Interface with Node and MySQL</h4>
                    <p>
                        The following CLI application let's users browse retail inventory and select a quantity of units
                        to purchase.
                        <br>
                        The app deploys in the Node.js environment. Output is viewed on the command prompt/ command
                        line/ PowerShell etc.,
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Running the Application </strong>
                        <br>
                        It is not necessary to run the application with argv.params. The application uses npm's inquirer
                        to walk the user through the functionality. The inquirer commands prompt the following:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong> id of the product of interest </strong></li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong> number of units to purchase </strong></li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Upon receiving user input on product id and the number of units, the application confirms the
                        product name with the user and confirms with the database that there is sufficient inventory. If
                        there is insufficient inventory, the user is informed and prompted on selecting a different
                        product, if desired. After every product submission, the user is prompted to determine whether
                        or not they'd like to submit an additional order. Learn more with the screenshots provided
                        below!

                        <p>
                            Users are prompted to take a short 10 question personality quiz. Data, via a POST method, is
                            sent to the server for processing. Processing consists of comparing user scores, stored in
                            an
                            array of objects generated by user participation, to one another to find users with the most
                            compatible personalities, measured according to their survey score.<br>
                            <br>

                            The application is hosted <a href="https://fierce-forest-11043.herokuapp.com/"
                                target="blank">here</a> but can also be run from a local server (8080).
                            Running a local server requires the following code in the terminal:<br>
                            <br>
                            ```
                            nodemon server.js
                            ```
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            See screenshots below of the brief user experience

                    <!--Burger App-->

                    <div>
                        <h4>Burgers and the Model-View-Controller</h4>
                        <p>
                            The burger app is about more than just burgers. It showcases GET, POST, and PUT requests
                            using AJAX calls to interact with a database using the Model-View-Controller(MVC)
                            architecture. The application uses callback functions in both the ORM, the models and the
                            controllers to communicate request and response data. In this case, the res and req data is:
                            1) the name of the burgers
                            and 2)a boolean variable representing devoured or eaten as true or false.

                            This application also includes a custom ORM that as aforementioned communicates seamlessly
                            with the model, the view(s), and the controller.

                            Stay tuned for the next iteration of the application which will use the popular Sequelize as
                            the ORM.<br>
