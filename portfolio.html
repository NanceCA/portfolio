                <h4>Node.js Constructor Word Guess</h4>
                <p>
                    The following application enables users to play a word guessing game on the command line. Users
                    guess the individual
                    letters of a word and are given a fixed amount of tries. The application interacts with the user
                    depending on whether or not their guess was correct and reveals the word, as correctly guessed,
                    along the way.

                    <h4>Retail Store Interface with Node and MySQL</h4>
                    <p>
                        The following CLI application let's users browse retail inventory and select a quantity of units
                        to purchase.
                        <br>
                        The app deploys in the Node.js environment. Output is viewed on the command prompt/ command
                        line/ PowerShell etc.,
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Running the Application </strong>
                        <br>
                        It is not necessary to run the application with argv.params. The application uses npm's inquirer
                        to walk the user through the functionality. The inquirer commands prompt the following:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong> id of the product of interest </strong>
                        <br>
                        <strong> number of units to purchase </strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Upon receiving user input on product id and the number of units, the application confirms the
                        product name with the user and confirms with the database that there is sufficient inventory. If
                        there is insufficient inventory, the user is informed and prompted on selecting a different
                        product, if desired. After every product submission, the user is prompted to determine whether
                        or not they'd like to submit an additional order. Learn more with the screenshots provided
                        below!
